Calculate the ratio in which the line joining A(-4,2) and B(3,6) is divided by the point P(x*,3). Also find (1)x  (2) length of AP

Solution:

The ratio in which the line is divided is 1:3
\begin{enumerate}
\item Now lets form the line equation which is 7y = 4x + 30.
Now by solving this equation for point P(x*,3) we get the value of x*=-9/4.
\item The length of the line AB = 8.062..(approx).
\end{enumerate}
